# FinTech-Homework-1---Case-Study BUNQ
	
	

	Bunq caught my attention because it toted itself as a “bank built by coders”. It was founded in 2012 by Iranian born Ali Niknam.
He came from a background in IT and was an original founder of TransIP; 

the largest Domain registrar in the Netherlands.  After some reading about Ali remarks on past and future projects it would 
come to no surprise that Bunq started out as a kind of brainchild project along the vein of a humanitarian effort. 
With Bunq Ali’s approach is aimed at achieving two goals; Removing the conventional brick-and-mortar associated with banks 
and to also take a more Service orientated approach. From a pure FinTech perspective Bunq is certainly not unique in its space. 
I want to talk about some of the technologies that companies like Bunq employs then go onto describe how I think Bunq has 
set itself apart along with some perceived shortcomings.  From a marketing perspective Bunq absolutely has characteristics 
that make it stand out, for better or worse.	
	Funding for Bunq remained completely devoid of an external Venture Capitalists. The founders felt that this would 
really take away from their ability to make Bunq a truly customer centric focused company, especially in its’ infancy.
The majority of initial funding would be classified as seed capital with no claims to any company control. Ali claims
this was a necessity.  By Sept 2015 they had raised 16.7 million Euros. By November the same year they were able to 
release their first beta mobile app. There is definitely a difference in a way a company is run when trying to maximize 
shareholder value as opposed to focusing on growing its customer base as well as satisfaction.
	I think itis important to look back before the rise of companies like Bunq and see where the demand for innovation was
coming from. Like many Fintech solutions Bunq is a company born from the need break down the so called current “value chain”. 
As well as being inspired by the frustrations of the global financial crisis in 2008. The idea of Fintech has been around but definitely got thrown into the spot light when bankers, investors and regulators all looked for a way to fix the mess they were in. Looking at how it happened would prove to give good insight on how to develop better methods going forward.
	Many point to deregulation as the primary catalyst for the meltdown. Since then heavy financial regulations in the 
form of acts have been slapped down to avoid the same type of disaster. The regulatory costs for staying in compliance became not just another burden, but an additional paywall trying to get into the Financial sector. The “Dodd-Frank” act, a set of
regulations put into place in response to the financial meltdown in 2008, alone has costs banking more than $36 billion 
since 2008. Using Fintech to reduce costs for all of these new “mobile banks” is a must have to remain competitive 
amongst peers. It is estimated that among the traditional banks their overall yearly spending costs can be anywhere between 
15-20%. As regulation technology in the financial sector begins to mature, we will begin to see the overall cost saving as well 
as unknown benefits. In short Regulation Technology will be a must have for any of these new firms. Cutting these costs 
alone grants them a higher tier amongst competitors. Bunq is no different, having to consider all the EU regulations 
and potential unique difference from country to country within the union. Just the mere fact that Bunq is a newcomer in 
the industry, like many others, they are able consider compliance as part of their current design when developing their 
value-chain process. Having most of it in code also means it is much easier to manage changes with any new regulatory act 
or policy.
	Each of Bunq’s approach to designing each one of its services has started from the customer’s view. Bunq initial goal was to be the first easy to use mobile friendly bank in the Netherlands by putting together suite of functions on a 
single platform. They tied together the ability to interact with a lot of commonly used methods present in the EU 
already. Being able to send money by doing away with an IBAN or SWIFT code appealed to many. Couple that with a service 
that integrated with SEPA (conventional EU cross-country method) and popular remittance services like TransferWise, Bunq 
would come out as a viable contender in the banking world across the EU.  Across many articles writing about fintech 
disruption the common reoccurring emphasis is on the “disaggregation of the value chain “. Bunq, like many other up and 
coming contenders in the finance world does a good job of leveraging the technology to achieve this.
	Where Bunq becomes divisive is in its philosophy about banking in general. Ali feels that many people do not understand 
the complications in running a bank. He has gone as far as launching a “Truth, Lies and Banking” Campaign.  Bunq’s series
of ads definitely targets the cynic in every account holder. The Campaign has some pretty over the top ads ranging anywhere
from comparing traditional banks with gangsters to them funding war and terrorism. I think its important to see that Bunq
doesn’t go so far as to explain how they can be different using the current Financial Technology. There are some great
companies out there that explain in a very non-technical way how new techs such as Blockchain are used for transparency. 
This is not done easily though. Your average person considers a lot of new Financial technologies complicated and foreign.
There are plenty of companies that have managed to deliver a non-technical understanding through clever slides and analogies.
Their current campaign tends to resort to pretty reductionist explanation on why banks are “bad”.  A simple graphic showing 
the expenses in the current value-chain model and how increasingly common finance tech removes or reduces these would be more
effective. There are various Blockchain endeavors that showcase its transparency as a bid to win the appeal for ethically minded 
consumers. After looking at some of Bunq’s campaigns they seem to fail making these kinds of connections for their audiences. 
Room for improvement certainly exists within Bunq’s campaign efforts.
	With the above in mind, the company definitely scoops up the simple yet savvy minded user. The company wants to appeal from anyone who needs a simple banking solution as well as down to individuals who need a sophisticated way to execute transactions and retrieve data. That could be someone who needs a no-frills simple method of storing and moving money around the EU quickly and cheaply. As well as an entity that needs a way to access funds programmatically; the ability to send\receive funds automatically and program physical cards with a set of rules. They even provide an open API along with a support team and community forum! I concede that this feature is probably only available for a very small percentage. I think its availability alone though is part of it’s “We are coders not bankers” and its “Bank of the people” persona. Bunq does not have the typical fees associated with a bank. They Market their company as a “bank with a social conscience” They have 3 different “products\services”, which have a static monthly fee. I think the appeal for a potential user is the level of details
and notes Bunq has available for you. From VAT calculation, tax prep statements, 3rd party software integration to personalized notes for receipts.  Bunq measure’s their success on the number of new accounts that have opened and remained active since it’s inception. Like many other companies they constantly request feedback and suggestions from their users to continue to make their service in demand. There are quite a few competitors in Bunq’s arena. MX platform, KonyDBX, N26 Bank Account, Chime, Azimo, World Remit etc. Technology wise Bunq doesn’t stand out. It has what is quickly becoming more and more standard in its realm’s competition; Application software, online banking, mobile app, fintech backed money transfers and payments etc. Bunq is also probably on the lower end in terms of profit margin but it has a particular draw across the arena in terms of wide functionality and ease of adoption. They have interesting products with some great feedback such as a card with dual PINs. You are able to pay for purchases from 2 different account depending on the PIN. Great solution for managing a joint account. From a user prospective, this level of ease of management is very attractive. Not to mention its green appeal with campaigns which will plant trees with use if it’s “Green Card” product.  It definitely has caught the attention from younger investors and people just entering the workforce. In addition to all of this, in an effort to appeal to the financially cynical, Bunq only invests the bare minimum of account holder money in order to hold a Banking license.  One might argue this could be lost potential 
revenue, but Bunq sees this as a value in security for their customers. Bunq even gives you the choice for where you invest that bare minimum for the yearly .32%. Those options are: Personal Lending, Personal Mortgages, Green Companies, All Companies, Other Bank Loans. It absolutely caters to the financially ethically minded persona. If one did some research on how banks have operated with customer finances in the past this might serve as a breath of fresh air. Regardless of how effective it is globally green appeal and ethically sound economics has a marketing value. Bunq makes it a point to remind you they are a different kind of company every chance they get. Some of Bunqs shortcomings have less to do witht hier use of technology and more to do with thier customer offerings. Some from an investors point of view and some from dissatisfied customers. There are some critical of Bunqs monthly fee of 8 Euros while there are a few alternatives without as many features. Consumers argue that most users will not use more than 1 banking card and that the 
API might appeal to .1% of all Bunq users. Another major complaint
is that there are limited account features when using a browser outside of your mobile device. I have definitely seen this trend amongst 
newer companies. For most of these companies it is an attempt to control user experience. There are plenty of competitors that offer a 
simplified version of Bunq’s services for a fraction or no cost at all. The API that Bunq offers seems to be fairly unique, albeit this 
exact feature is criticized for existing for Fintech within banking is slowly picking apart the traditional banking value chain. 
Making it more transparent, cheaper, faster and giving rise to some modularity; the ability for specific processes to exist outside a 
single institution. It wouldn’t be a surprise when eventually companies in the same arena of Bunq will be compared to piecemeal IT services 
such as Azure or AWS for finances. In the same way cloud services have given a rise to the likes of PaaS, MaaS, SaaS (Platform\Metal\Software
as a service). It is predicted that Fintech will eventually do the same through the disaggregation of current traditional processes. I think 
this may also give rise to the opposite. Services that you normally wouldn’t see aggregated together. I am surprised that we haven’t seen a 
brokerage and banking all in one this late in the game. This is something that Bunq is looking to do. Robinhood, already the de-facto mobile 
trading app, has interests in getting into banking. I’d like to mention banking apps that have been developed for use in the EU in general. 
There is a really obvious need for this type of service becomes very apparent just travelling within the EU. Whether you are moving from 
country to country or need to send money to an EU member there are fees and hold up associated with traditional methods. Companies like Bunq 
also tie into some existing services also using some sort of fintech. Mentioned earlier, TransferWise can be used in conjunction within the
Bunq financial ‘network’ too little to no fees.A traditional bank with much heavier overhead costs in terms of assets (property) as well as 
process costs will either cease to exist or adopt similar strategies to maintain their customer base. Its easy to see why a person would want 
have their liquid assets in a single easy to use platform with the utmost flexibility given. Again, Bunq excels at being extremely accessible 
and versatile in all the above mentioned. There are many alternatives but none seem to get the reverence and fandom that this companies mobile 
app seems to get. I think rapid user adoption is what will decide who is left when the dust settles. It is still too early to tell what the 
majority of users will end up valuing the most from mobile banking. There is still a large untapped userbase that is more or less distrustful 
in putting money into an institution that they can’t walk into. Bunq’s strategy seems to have positioned itself for expansion rather than 
profits. Long term this will be important as competition will be very fierce as the new technologies mature. Bunq already has plans to expand 
into the UK. A service like this will be invaluable given the situation UK is facing with its shaky Brexit resolution. In fact there are many 
frequent UK travelers that end up getting Blunq or equivalent service for travel in the EU. There might be some significant changes banks will 
need to make in light of the current transition the UK is making out of the European Union. Compared to a traditional banks Blunq and 
other competitors will be in a less risky position to handle a lot of uncertainty that comes from handling cross border payments to and 
from an Ex-EU member. National economic uncertainty has never been kind to ones currency. Crypto’s are too far ahead of themselves at
the moment to be of any use to your average person. It is going to be companies that utilize these techs and provide a turnkey product
backed up by some level
	By 2017 Bunq moved their entire infrastructure to the cloud. Now AWS houses all of their code, storage and transactions. Outside of 
private keys, they are completely cloud driven. Many FinTechs make use of cloud services to cut costs and to stay poised for scalability.
Services like AWS are built to meet rigorous requirements that many financial firms require.  For Bunq this will make expanding into
new territory, offering new services and meeting the ever-demanding regulations a lot easier. Paying only for what you use in the 
cloud removes a large amount of uncertainty and risk for any type of company.  I would argue that the incorporation of cloud 
technologies for banking(transaction resources, security, storage) can be chalked up to a technology that has disrupted an 
industry within finance. Not all of the newer contenders have adopted the cloud.
Stackshare and bunq’s developer blog (https://developer.bunq.com/ ) lists C#,JAVA, PHP and Python as the core language used in 
bunqs product offerings. Bunq seems to be very involved with their community; Hosting events and being very active on their forums.
This is definitely another one of the factos that Bunq uses to set itself apart for other new mobile banking solutions. Bunq aims 
to be feature rich and driven almost entirely from user feedback. There have also been complaints that their app may be a bit too 
feature rich. 
	From a fintech prespective doesn’t set itself apart from have any special innovative tech that is new to the realm. Instead I would 
argue that it curates a lot of in demand functionality and wraps it up with great marketing, accessibility and pretty colors. It 
has made a name for itself as an “ethically minded bank”. They host regular events in Amsterdam which showcases new ideas and 
features. They want their users to feel that they are not paying for unneeded overhead and that their company is as transparent as 
can be.  They have 3 different “products\services”, which have a static monthly fee.  I think the fact that they tech heads at heart, 
always looking for a better\faster\cheaper way , are geared for expansion and have a really great relationship with their community
make them a top choice amongst mobile banking for future success.
